# CNN_Image_Classification_on_Caltech101
This repository contains my solution for laboratory 1 of the course "Advanced Machine Learning" held on Polytechnic University of Turin in academic year 2022/2023.

</br>We've performed a classification task on Caltech101 dataset by implementing simple AlexNet, then Transfer Learning & Data Augmentation have been added.
</br><code>TODO</code> At the end a solution with other kind of nets have been provided.

Every folder contains the PDF of the exercise and the Jupyter Notebook with the working code.
